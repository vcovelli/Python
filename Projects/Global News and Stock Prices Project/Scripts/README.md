# Global News and Stock Prices Project

This project combines news articles and stock price data to provide a consolidated view of both types of information. It fetches the latest news related to finance and the current stock prices of popular tickers (such as AAPL, GOOG, and AMZN). The final output is a combined dataset containing both the news and stock data for easy analysis.

## Features
- Fetches the latest finance-related news articles using the News API.
- Retrieves stock price data for a list of tickers using Yahoo Finance.
- Combines news and stock data into a single dataset for further analysis.
- Outputs the consolidated data to the console and saves it to a CSV file.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following packages need to be installed:

- `requests` - to make HTTP requests to the News API.
- `yfinance` - to retrieve stock price data.
- `pandas` - to handle data manipulation and storage.

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install requests yfinance pandas
```
