**Connect to PostgreSQL Interactive Terminal:**

psql -U postgres


**Create a Database:**

CREATE DATABASE test_db;


**Switch Database:**

\c test_db


**Create a Table:**

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2)
);


**Insert Data into a Table**

INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department, salary)
VALUES 
    ('Alice Johnson', 30, 'Marketing', 55000.00),
    ('Bob Smith', 24, 'Sales', 45000.00),
    ('Carol Williams', 40, 'Engineering', 75000.00),
    ('David Brown', 35, 'Human Resources', 62000.00);

**Navigation**

Use / for PostgreSQL commands like Linux

PostgreSQL doesn't recognize \ in command strings


**Query the Table**

SELECT * FROM employees;


**Basic Queries**

--Select specific columns--
SELECT name, department FROM employees;

--Filter rows--
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;

--Calculate an average--
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

--Updating Data--
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 58000.00
WHERE name = 'Alice Johnson';

--Deleting Data--
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE name = 'Bob Smith';


**Advanced Queries**

--Filtering with Multiple Conditions--
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE age > 30 AND department = 'Engineering';

--Sorting Results--
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

--Using Aggregate Functions--
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_payroll FROM employees;


**Grouping and Aggregating Data**

--Group By--
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

--Using HAVING--
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;


**Creating Relationships Between Tables**

1. Create a 'projects' Table:
CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(100),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

2. Insert Data into 'projects'
INSERT INTO projects (project_name, start_date, end_date, department)
VALUES
    ('Marketing Campaign', '2024-01-15', '2024-03-15', 'Marketing'),
    ('New Product Development', '2024-02-01', '2024-06-30', 'Engineering'),
    ('Employee Onboarding', '2024-03-01', '2024-04-15', 'Human Resources');

3. Join the Tables
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, e.department, p.project_name
FROM employees e
JOIN projects p ON e.department = p.department;


**Backing Up and Restoring Data**

--Backing Up a Database--
pg_dump -U postgres test_db > test_db_backup.sql

--Restoring a Database--
psql -U postgres -d test_db -f test_db_backup.sql


**Window Functions**

Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row without grouping them into a single row. 
They are ideal for rankings, moving averages, cumulative sums, and more.

Key Components:
PARTITION BY: Divides rows into groups, like GROUP BY, but doesn't collapse rows.
ORDER BY: Determines the order of rows within a partition.

Examples: Running Total (Cumulative Sales per Customer)
--
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    sale_date,
    sale_amount,
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_sales
FROM sales;

SUM(sale_amount) calculates a running total of sales.
PARTITION BY customer_id restarts the calculation for each customer.
ORDER BY sale_date ensures the cumulative total is calculated in chronological order.

RANK(): Assigns a rank, skipping numbers for ties.
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique row number.
LAG() and LEAD(): Fetch values from the previous or next row.

Example: Rank Customers by Total Sales
--
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sale_amount) DESC) AS rank
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;


**Summary

--Window Functions: Great for rankings and cumulative calculations.

--CTEs: Simplify complex queries.

--Triggers: Automate actions based on table events.

--Query Optimization: Improve performance with indexes and analysis.

--Advanced Reporting: Create detailed analytics.

--Recursive CTEs: Solve hierarchical problems.

--JSON/JSONB: Work with semi-structured data.

--Full-Text Search: Search text data efficiently.
